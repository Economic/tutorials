# R Tutorials
This repository stores available R tutorials.

## Background
[R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is an open source coding language and environment. In combination with [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/packages/), R is a powerful and flexible language that is particularly useful for data manipulationa & visualization and statistical computation. Relative to Stata, R can also be leveraged to flexibly import various data sources by utilizing API packages (see [blsR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=blsR) and [bea.R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bea.R/bea.R.pdf)) and has more powerful capabilities to map data to excel (see [openxlsx](https://cran.r-project.org/package=openxlsx)).

## Setting up RStudio
To fully utilize this tutorial please follow [these instructions](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) to download RStudio Desktop. For Maynard users, please inquiry to Jori or Zane about accessing the VPN and RStudio browser.

## R Basics
[`rtutorial.R`](https://github.com/Economic/tutorials/blob/master/rtutorial.R) is a general overview of basic R concepts and applies simple statistical aggregations on common data pulls typical for EPI projects and products for explanatory purposes.

## BEA Tutorial
[`bea_sample_code`](https://github.com/Economic/tutorials/tree/master/bea_sample_code) explores the capabilities of the BEA API R package and is written for demonstrative purposes, including pulling NIPA data using [manual](https://github.com/Economic/tutorials/blob/master/bea_sample_code/nipa_sample_code.R) and [automated](https://github.com/Economic/tutorials/blob/master/bea_sample_code/nipa_sample_code_function.R) processes and testing [regional data pulls](https://github.com/Economic/tutorials/blob/master/bea_sample_code/regional_sample_code.R).

## BLS Tutorial
[`bls_sample_code`](https://github.com/Economic/tutorials/tree/master/bls_sample_code) breakouts out the BLS function for demonstrative purposes.
